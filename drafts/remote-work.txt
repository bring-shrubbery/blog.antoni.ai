If you've ever needed a job you
have probably been in the
cringeland of Linkedin.
It's the site where you go when
you want to be reminded what
"resources" mean in "Human
Resources".

There is a misconception among many leaders about the source of high quality collaborative work.
Many people in leadership positions seem to think that efficient collaboration at work is only possible when people are physically in one room, having a "real" conversation.
Although I mildly agree with this statement, it is very similar to saying something like "my car goes really fast, because it has a huge engine".
Although not completely false, having a big engine in a car doesn't grant you speed, efficiency does.
Every kind of efficiency contributes to faster car, whether it's efficiency of your engine or the shape of your car (aerodynamic efficiency).
Same goes for conversations.
Efficient conversation is the backbone of productive collaboration, and the one thing that have persisted among all efficient conversations I had in my life is the ability to listen.
The company leaders who inspired me to write this blog in the first place don't seem to know anything about this.
To summarise the average in-person meeting I had at that company I made a list of issues I saw, which prevented effective collaboration:

- Talking over each other
- Not hearing what others say while just repeating their own point over and over again.
- After a period of engaging in back-and-forth conversation, one of those leaders just forgot that I am in the room, and stopped talking completely, focusing on what's happening in their computer.
- Picking up the phone in a middle of talking with me, talking to someone else.
